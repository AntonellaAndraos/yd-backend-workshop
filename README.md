# Re:Coded: Back-end Web Development

## Welcome!

Over the course of this week we'll take your existing HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills from the client to the server with technologies like _Node.js_, _Express_, _EJS_, , _Passport_, _SQL_, and _MySQL_. By the end of the week you'll be able to build your own website backends using these technologies from scratch.

In fact, if you follow along, you will have built one yourself by the end of the week already!

But, more than the specifics of Node.js, Express, and SQL, I hope to leave you with an understanding of the concepts underlying these technologies so that you can:

- Easily adapt your new skills to other server-side technologies
- Develop an awareness of other popular options
- Give you a mental model for evaluating these other technologies

Along the way we'll discuss topics like _Common Website Security Vulnerabilities_, _AJAX_, _OAuth_, _Scaling_, _NoSQL_, _Mobile Apps_, and _Cloud Computing_.

We will be moving at a fast pace and covering a lot of material! Don't get discouraged! I am here for you the whole week, and we will get through it together.
